### To run the app and the contracts
```bash
./go.sh
```

### CI Pipeline
[SNAP CI](https://snap-ci.com/davecroman/coffee-api-challenge/branch/master)

### Production Endpoint
https://coffee-store.herokuapp.com/menu

### Service Guarantees
Our baristas ensure that it takes exactly 60 seconds to prepare any cup of coffee no matter how large the queue is.

### The Challenge
Create an API that passes the PACTO contract tests in this repository.

### Disclaimer
This is our first time doing a Ruby application from scratch so take all the implementation in this codebase with a grain of salt
